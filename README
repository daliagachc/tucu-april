	aparently is more complex to run cfsv2 as compared to cfsr. 
	i found this post with useful info:
		http://forum.wrfforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=9558
	also i needed to download the correct Vtables
		Vtable.CFSR_sfc_flxf06
		Vtable.CFSR_press_pgbh06
	from 
		http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/download/free_data.html

Wed 23 Jan 2019 02:08:40 PM EET
	created 2 dirs: sur and pre to download respective data. 

Wed 23 Jan 2019 03:18:06 PM EET
	files downloaded

Wed 23 Jan 2019 05:07:46 PM EET
	run ungrib with multiple cores and found the error:
		â”‚ERROR: unknown out_format, ifv =
	forum post: http://forum.wrfforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=8358
	suggests to run as a sinfle process instead to fix this error 

Wed 23 Jan 2019 06:18:18 PM EET 
	run ungrib again but with 12 cores and giving 1h clocktime since 10m was not enough.

Wed 23 Jan 2019 06:50:01 PM EET
	again same error. running on serial mode and increasing mem to 8 G 
	error egain. 
Wed 23 Jan 2019 08:11:29 PM EET
	the problem is that file are named the same inside tar so we need a different command to uname those. 
	before i was using:
		for f in *.tar; do tar xf $f; done
	now: 
		for f in *.tar; do tar --transform=s/^/pre_${f}_/S -xf $f; done
	with this, file are untared with the source file name prepended

Thu 24 Jan 2019 10:58:56 AM EET
	run out of space in the app directory while running ungrid. i should copy the executables to the working directory and run from there. i can even copy the whole WPS directory since it is below 100mb. 3 


Thu 24 Jan 2019 01:34:26 PM EET
	manange to run ungrib.exe for HOURLY 

Thu 24 Jan 2019 02:02:10 PM EET
	aparently the default vtable that comes with wps fro cfsr model is enough as it contains the coordenates vro both the surface and the pressure files

Thu 24 Jan 2019 03:05:02 PM EET
	done running metgrid. now time to run real 

Wed 06 Feb 2019 12:05:36 PM EET
	run it again and process was cancelled due to time limit. 

Wed Feb  6 12:28:59 2019
	estarted git V03
	- goals 
		run just 1 hour 
		10 minute history 
Wed 06 Feb 2019 04:47:33 PM EET
	- running again but this time with 6 hours to see if i get out for all domains	

Wed 06 Feb 2019 05:27:18 PM EET
	finally found the problem:
	history_interval (in namelist.input) must be defined for all domains otherwise its assumed to be 0! 

Wed 06 Feb 2019 09:55:42 PM EET
	running v05 with 3 days ~ 
	error for real ~ not enough memory
	memory was 4 g now is 8 g 
	increased running time for wrf from 10 to 20 hours

Thu 07 Feb 2019 02:04:34 PM EET
	run was succesfull. it was completed at 7:45 am EET (~10 hours) 

Thu 07 Feb 2019 02:28:43 PM EET
	now trying v06 similar to v05 but with 32 cores instead of 24. lets see if we can reproduce the previous error. 
	error reproduced. see file ./run_logs/rsl.out.0000

Fri 08 Feb 2019 01:56:19 PM EET
	v07
	lets increase the size of d04 as suggested by Victoria
