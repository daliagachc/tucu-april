	aparently is more complex to run cfsv2 as compared to cfsr. 
	i found this post with useful info:
		http://forum.wrfforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=9558
	also i needed to download the correct Vtables
		Vtable.CFSR_sfc_flxf06
		Vtable.CFSR_press_pgbh06
	from 
		http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/download/free_data.html

	forum post: http://forum.wrfforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=8358

Wed 23 Jan 2019 06:18:18 PM EET 
	run ungrib again but with 12 cores and giving 1h clocktime since 10m was not enough.

	error egain. 
Wed 23 Jan 2019 08:11:29 PM EET
	the problem is that file are named the same inside tar so we need a different command to uname those. 
	before i was using:
		for f in *.tar; do tar xf $f; done
	now: 
		for f in *.tar; do tar --transform=s/^/pre_${f}_/S -xf $f; done
	with this, file are untared with the source file name prepended

	run out of space in the app directory while running ungrid. i should copy the executables to the working directory and run from there. i can even copy the whole WPS directory since it is below 100mb. 3

Thu 24 Jan 2019 02:02:10 PM EET
	aparently the default vtable that comes with wps fro cfsr model is enough as it contains the coordenates vro both the surface and the pressure files
